## Explanation 

My go-to cloud-init script to run Jellyfin

### Jellyfin
Jellyfin is a media server. It's sole purpouse is to make your local media streamable from your phone etc...

### Nginx Reverse Proxy
I am using Nginx here, because Jellyfin's internal webserver provides no security measures or logging. Also, SSL is much easier using certbot when Nginx is used.

### CIFS Mount
I mount my Storage system (172.16.0.16) on the VM, so that jellyfin can have access to the media.
Integrating the adding of a media library to Jellyfin automatically seems to be impossible, as there is no config file to add/remove libraries

As you can see, the website supports SSL. This is why i am using Nginx in my cloud-init
